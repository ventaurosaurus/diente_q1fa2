                    <h1>Diana of Themyscira</h1>
                    <p>Wonder Woman was popular with readers for many reasons.
                       For a nation engulfed in World War II, her unwavering patriotism was welcome. 
                       Male readers enjoyed the adventures of a scantily clad woman who was drawn in
                       the style of one of Esquire magazines Varga Girl pinups and who was often 
                       tied up by male or female villains. Critics—most notably anti-comics polemicist
                       Frederic Wertham—would call attention to the preponderance of bondage in Wonder Woman
                       stories, but Marston claimed such scenes to be allusions to suffragist imagery. 
                       (This defense strained credibility, however, as the concept of “loving submission” to 
                       authority was pervasive throughout both Wonder Woman comics and Marstons personal life.) 
                       Female readers liked the series because it presented a strong and confident woman who often spoke
                       about the power of womanhood and the need for female solidarity. In an industry where superheroines 
                       tended to be used for cheesecake titillation or as adjuncts to their more powerful and popular male
                       counterparts, Wonder Woman stood apart. 
                       Unlike Superman or Batman, the other members of what would come to be known as DCs “trinity,” 
                       Wonder Woman would never develop an especially memorable gallery of villains. Among her persistent 
                       foes were the catlike Cheetah, the towering Giganta, the sorceress Circe, and the telepath Dr. Psycho, 
                       whose mental powers were a sinister inversion of Marstons “loving submission” credo. Besides appearing
                       in her own two titles, Wonder Woman was a featured member of the Justice Society of America
                       in the pages of All Star Comics. Wonder Woman is fearless and focused on her objectives. She 
                       will not hesitate to break the law if it's for the greater good. She will not hide from her 
                       actions and always makes herself available to face the consequences.</p>
